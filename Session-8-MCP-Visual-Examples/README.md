# Session 8: MCP (Model Context Protocol) - Before vs After Visual Guide

## 🎯 The Complete Journey: From Chaos to Coordination

This session demonstrates the **dramatic transformation** when using MCP to coordinate multiple AI models. You'll experience the "before and after" effect that makes MCP invaluable.

## 📋 Prerequisites - Quick Check

### ✅ **Verify Your System is Ready**

**Check Ollama is Running:**
```bash
# Check if Ollama service is running
curl http://localhost:11434/api/tags
```

**Or Test via Browser:**
```
Open your browser and go to: http://localhost:11434/api/tags
You should see a JSON response with your models
```

**Test Your Models:**
```bash
# Test any available model (replace with your model name)
curl -X POST http://localhost:11434/api/generate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model": "phi-fast:latest", "prompt": "Hello", "stream": false}'
```

**That's it!** If the commands above return responses, you're ready to start the MCP session.

## 🎭 **The Three-Step Learning Experience**

### **STEP 1: BEFORE MCP** ❌
**The Manual, Frustrating Process:**

**Student wants to learn: "Plan a 3-day trip to Paris for a family with kids"**

```bash
# Student manually tries different models:

# Try 1: Wrong model choice
curl -X POST http://localhost:11434/api/generate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model": "deepseek-coder-fast:latest", "prompt": "Plan a 3-day trip to Paris for a family with kids", "stream": false}'

# Result: ❌ REFUSED TO HELP
"I'm sorry... as an AI model developed by Deepseek specifically designed towards answering computer science related queries and not suitable for planning travel itineraries..."

# Try 2: Student has to guess again
curl -X POST http://localhost:11434/api/generate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model": "phi-fast:latest", "prompt": "Plan a 3-day trip to Paris for a family with kids", "stream": false}'

# Result: ✅ Works, but student wasted time guessing
```

**The Painful Reality:**
- ❌ **Manual model guessing** - Student doesn't know which model to use
- ❌ **Wrong choices** - Coding models refuse travel questions
- ❌ **Wasted time** - Multiple failed attempts before success
- ❌ **Frustrating experience** - Technical barriers block learning
- ❌ **No guidance** - Student left to figure out model specializations

### **STEP 2: WITH MCP** ✅
**The Coordinated, Intelligent Process:**

**Same question: "Plan a 3-day trip to Paris for a family with kids"**

```bash
# Simple MCP command
python3 smart_chat.py "Plan a 3-day trip to Paris for a family with kids"

# MCP automatically:
# 🧠 Analyzes question keywords: ['plan', 'trip', 'Paris', 'family']
# 🎯 Detects question type: travel_planning
# ✅ Selects appropriate model: phi-fast:latest
# 🚀 Gets helpful response immediately
```

**The Magic Benefits:**
- ✅ **One simple command** - Natural language question
- ✅ **Automatic model selection** - No guessing required
- ✅ **Always works** - Right model chosen every time
- ✅ **Immediate success** - No failed attempts or refusals
- ✅ **Focus on learning** - Not on technical model details

### **STEP 3: MCP INTELLIGENCE** 🧠
**Smart Model Selection & Orchestration:**

```
🎯 MCP DECISION ENGINE IN ACTION:

Question Analysis: "Plan a 3-day trip to Paris for a family with kids"
├── Detected Keywords: ['plan', 'trip', 'Paris', 'family', 'kids']
├── Question Type: travel_planning
├── Model Selection Logic:
│   ├── ❌ Avoid: deepseek-coder-fast (coding specialist, refuses travel)
│   ├── ✅ Choose: phi-fast:latest (general model, handles travel well)
│   └── Reason: Travel keywords detected, need general-purpose model
│
└── Result: Helpful travel itinerary with attractions and tips
```

## 🛠️ **Hands-On: Build Your MCP System**

### **Files You'll Work With:**
- **`smart-mcp.json`** - MCP routing configuration with smart model selection rules
- **`smart_chat.py`** - CLI script that demonstrates automatic model routing
- **`demo-comparison.sh`** - Before/After demonstration script

### **Step 1: Test Smart Model Selection**

**Travel Question (routes to phi-fast:latest):**
```bash
cd hands-on/json-mcp/
python3 smart_chat.py "What's the best time to visit Paris?"
```

**Coding Question (routes to deepseek-coder-fast:latest):**
```bash
python3 smart_chat.py "Write a Python function to sort a list"
```

**General Question (routes to mistral:latest):**
```bash
python3 smart_chat.py "Explain what machine learning is"
```

### **Step 2: See the Complete Transformation**
```bash
# Run the before/after demo
./demo-comparison.sh
```

### **Step 3: Understand the Routing Logic**

The `smart-mcp.json` file contains simple routing rules:

| Question Type | Keywords | Selected Model | Why |
|---------------|----------|----------------|-----|
| **Travel** | trip, travel, visit, vacation, plan | phi-fast:latest | General model good for travel |
| **Coding** | function, code, programming, debug | deepseek-coder-fast:latest | Specialized coding model |
| **General** | explain, what is, how to | mistral:latest | Good for explanations |
